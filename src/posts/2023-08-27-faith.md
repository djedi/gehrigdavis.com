"Faith without works is dead."
Sometimes we think that all we need to do is have faith and then God will do the rest. Often times while reading the Scriptures, we find that prophets pray for strength to overcome their obstacles, rather then changing them.

Faith is action. Though we know we are saved by grace, we are judged according to our works. Message us if you want to follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized.
