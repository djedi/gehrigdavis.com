# About this Site

Gehrig is a passionate missionary who wants to share the gospel with others because of his love for the Savior, Jesus Christ.

However, Gehrig also has aspirations of becoming an entrepreneur when he returns from his mission. As part of his personal growth plan, he has set a goal to post a weekly video on Facebook in order to become more comfortable in front of a camera. By doing so, he hopes to gain confidence and expand the reach of his message by connecting with more people who are open to hearing the gospel.

Every Sunday night, our family eagerly anticipates watching these videos on Facebook to see what Gehrig's latest message will be.

To ensure that these videos are easily accessible and can be enjoyed even after Gehrig completes his mission, we have created this website. There are two main reasons for creating this site:

  1. **Video Journal**: This website will serve as a video journal for Gehrig and his family, allowing them to look back on their journey and reflect on the impact they have made.
  1. **Wider Audience**: Not everyone has access to Facebook, so this website provides an alternative platform for people who are not on Facebook to watch Gehrig's videos and be inspired by his message.

We hope that this website will not only preserve Gehrig's mission experiences but also inspire and touch the lives of those who visit it.
